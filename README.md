### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Boaz Ato Micah, and I am interested in writing algorithms for quantum computers. I am new to this field and am currently working on tackling good first issues on Qiskit.

My Master's thesis involved investigating the crystal structure of the two-dimensional material known as Vanadium tri-iodide. You can explore the complete project at [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/Boaz-ato/Masters-Thesis/blob/main/Master_Thesis.pdf).

I have compiled a directory containing code templates for various machine learning algorithms, including regression models, classification models, clustering, NLP, convolutional neural networks, supervised learning, and more. This directory can be accessed at [Machine Learning Templates](https://github.com/Boaz-ato/Machine_learning_templates).

Additionally, I invite you to take a look at my Grover search project, where I implemented Grover's algorithm without relying on any external libraries. Feel free to interact with the project at [Grover Project](https://portfolio-boaz-ato-micah.herokuapp.com/grover). The source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/yanchovies/Quantum-Computing-Project-Group-1).
